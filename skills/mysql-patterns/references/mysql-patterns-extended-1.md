| Anti-Pattern | Risk | Better Pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SELECT *` in hot paths | Over-fetching and brittle clients | Select explicit columns |
| Deep `OFFSET` pagination | Linear scans and slow pages | Keyset pagination |
| No index on foreign-key joins | Slow joins and lock-heavy deletes | Index FK columns intentionally |
| Long transactions | Lock waits and large undo history | Commit small units of work |
| Application user with admin grants | High blast radius | Least-privilege runtime user |
| Pool recycle above `wait_timeout` | Stale pooled connections | Recycle below timeout and pre-ping |
| Replica reads after writes | Stale user-facing state | Pin read-after-write flows to primary |

## Output Expectations

When this skill is used for review, return:

1. Engine/version assumptions.
2. Highest-risk correctness, lock, security, and migration issues.
3. Exact SQL or code changes for the safe path.
4. Validation plan: `EXPLAIN`, migration dry run, lock/deadlock check, and rollback criteria.
5. Any MySQL/MariaDB syntax differences that affect the recommendation.
