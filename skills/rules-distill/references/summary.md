# Rules Distill

Scan installed skills, extract cross-cutting principles that appear in multiple skills, and distill them into rules — appending to existing rule files, revising outdated content, or creating new rule files.

Applies the "deterministic collection + LLM judgment" principle: scripts collect facts exhaustively, then an LLM cross-reads the full context and produces verdicts.

## When to Use

- Periodic rules maintenance (monthly or after installing new skills)
- After a skill-stocktake reveals patterns that should be rules
- When rules feel incomplete relative to the skills being used

## How It Works

The rules distillation process follows three phases:

### Phase 1: Inventory (Deterministic Collection)

#### 1a. Collect skill inventory

[See code example 1 in `code-examples.md`]

#### 1b. Collect rules index

[See code example 2 in `code-examples.md`]

#### 1c. Present to user

[See code example 3 in `code-examples.md`]

### Phase 2: Cross-read, Match & Verdict (LLM Judgment)

Extraction and matching are unified in a single pass. Rules files are small enough (~800 lines total) that the full text can be provided to the LLM — no grep pre-filtering needed.

#### Batching

Group skills into **thematic clusters** based on their descriptions. Analyze each cluster in a subagent with the full rules text.

#### Cross-batch Merge

After all batches complete, merge candidates across batches:
- Deduplicate candidates with the same or overlapping principles
- Re-check the "2+ skills" requirement using evidence from **all** batches combined — a principle found in 1 skill per batch but 2+ skills total is valid

#### Subagent Prompt

Launch a general-purpose Agent with the following prompt:

[See code example 4 in `code-examples.md`]
json
{
  "principle": "1-2 sentences in 'do X' / 'don't do Y' form",
  "evidence": ["skill-name: §Section", "skill-name: §Section"],
  "violation_risk": "1 sentence",
  "verdict": "Append / Revise / New Section / New File / Already Covered / Too Specific",
  "target_rule": "filename §Section, or 'new'",
  "confidence": "high / medium / low",
  "draft": "Draft text for Append/New Section/New File verdicts",
  "revision": {
    "reason": "Why the existing content is inaccurate or insufficient (Revise only)",
    "before": "Current text to be replaced (Revise only)",
    "after": "Proposed replacement text (Revise only)"
  }
}

#### Verdict Reference

| Verdict | Meaning | Presented to User |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Append** | Add to existing section | Target + draft |
| **Revise** | Fix inaccurate/insufficient content | Target + reason + before/after |
| **New Section** | Add new section to existing file | Target + draft |
| **New File** | Create new rule file | Filename + full draft |
| **Already Covered** | Covered in rules (possibly different wording) | Reason (1 line) |
| **Too Specific** | Should stay in skills | Link to relevant skill |
