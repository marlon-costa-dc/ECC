| Score | Meaning | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 0.3 | Tentative | Suggested but not enforced |
| 0.5 | Moderate | Applied when relevant |
| 0.7 | Strong | Auto-approved for application |
| 0.9 | Near-certain | Core behavior |

**Confidence increases** when:
- Pattern is repeatedly observed
- User doesn't correct the suggested behavior
- Similar instincts from other sources agree

**Confidence decreases** when:
- User explicitly corrects the behavior
- Pattern isn't observed for extended periods
- Contradicting evidence appears

## Why Hooks vs Skills for Observation?

> "v1 relied on skills to observe. Skills are probabilistic -- they fire ~50-80% of the time based on Claude's judgment."

Hooks fire **100% of the time**, deterministically. This means:
- Every tool call is observed
- No patterns are missed
- Learning is comprehensive

## Backward Compatibility

v2.1 is fully compatible with v2.0 and v1:
- Existing global instincts can be migrated from `~/.claude/homunculus/instincts/` with `scripts/migrate-homunculus.sh`
- Existing `~/.claude/skills/learned/` skills from v1 still work
- Stop hook still runs (but now also feeds into v2)
- Gradual migration: run both in parallel

## Privacy

- Observations stay **local** on your machine
- Project-scoped instincts are isolated per project
- Only **instincts** (patterns) can be exported — not raw observations
- No actual code or conversation content is shared
- You control what gets exported and promoted
