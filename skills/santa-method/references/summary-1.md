### Phase 3: Naughty or Nice (Verdict Gate)

```python
def santa_verdict(review_b, review_c):
    """Both reviewers must pass. No partial credit."""
    if review_b.verdict == "PASS" and review_c.verdict == "PASS":
        return "NICE"  # Ship it

# Merge flags from both reviewers, deduplicate
    all_issues = dedupe(review_b.critical_issues + review_c.critical_issues)
    all_suggestions = dedupe(review_b.suggestions + review_c.suggestions)

return "NAUGHTY", all_issues, all_suggestions
```

Why both must pass: if only one reviewer catches an issue, that issue is real. The other reviewer's blind spot is exactly the failure mode Santa Method exists to eliminate.

### Phase 4: Fix Until Nice (Convergence Loop)

```python
MAX_ITERATIONS = 3

for iteration in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):
    verdict, issues, suggestions = santa_verdict(review_b, review_c)

if verdict == "NICE":
        log_santa_result(output, iteration, "passed")
        return ship(output)

# Fix all critical issues (suggestions are optional)
    output = fix_agent.execute(
        output=output,
        issues=issues,
        instruction="Fix ONLY the flagged issues. Do not refactor or add unrequested changes."
    )

# Re-run BOTH reviewers on fixed output (fresh agents, no memory of previous round)
    review_b = Agent(prompt=REVIEWER_PROMPT.format(output=output, ...))
    review_c = Agent(prompt=REVIEWER_PROMPT.format(output=output, ...))

# Exhausted iterations — escalate
log_santa_result(output, MAX_ITERATIONS, "escalated")
escalate_to_human(output, issues)
```

Critical: each review round uses **fresh agents**. Reviewers must not carry memory from previous rounds, as prior context creates anchoring bias.

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern A: Claude Code Subagents (Recommended)

Subagents provide true context isolation. Each reviewer is a separate process with no shared state.

```bash
# In a Claude Code session, use the Agent tool to spawn reviewers
# Both agents run in parallel for speed
```

```python
# Pseudocode for Agent tool invocation
reviewer_b = Agent(
    description="Santa Review B",
    prompt=f"Review this output for quality...\n\nRUBRIC:\n{rubric}\n\nOUTPUT:\n{output}"
)
reviewer_c = Agent(
    description="Santa Review C",
    prompt=f"Review this output for quality...\n\nRUBRIC:\n{rubric}\n\nOUTPUT:\n{output}"
)
```

### Pattern B: Sequential Inline (Fallback)

When subagents aren't available, simulate isolation with explicit context resets:

1. Generate output
2. New context: "You are Reviewer 1. Evaluate ONLY against this rubric. Find problems."
3. Record findings verbatim
4. Clear context completely
5. New context: "You are Reviewer 2. Evaluate ONLY against this rubric. Find problems."
6. Compare both reviews, fix, repeat

The subagent pattern is strictly superior — inline simulation risks context bleed between reviewers.

### Pattern C: Batch Sampling

For large batches (100+ items), full Santa on every item is cost-prohibitive. Use stratified sampling:

1. Run Santa on a random sample (10-15% of batch, minimum 5 items)
2. Categorize failures by type (hallucination, compliance, completeness, etc.)
3. If systematic patterns emerge, apply targeted fixes to the entire batch
4. Re-sample and re-verify the fixed batch
5. Continue until a clean sample passes

```python
import random

def santa_batch(items, rubric, sample_rate=0.15):
    sample = random.sample(items, max(5, int(len(items) * sample_rate)))

for item in sample:
        result = santa_full(item, rubric)
        if result.verdict == "NAUGHTY":
            pattern = classify_failure(result.issues)
            items = batch_fix(items, pattern)  # Fix all items matching pattern
            return santa_batch(items, rubric)   # Re-sample

return items  # Clean sample → ship batch
```

## Failure Modes and Mitigations

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Mitigation |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| Infinite loop | Reviewers keep finding new issues after fixes | Max iteration cap (3). Escalate. |
| Rubber stamping | Both reviewers pass everything | Adversarial prompt: "Your job is to find problems, not approve." |
| Subjective drift | Reviewers flag style preferences, not errors | Tight rubric with objective pass/fail criteria only |
| Fix regression | Fixing issue A introduces issue B | Fresh reviewers each round catch regressions |
| Reviewer agreement bias | Both reviewers miss the same thing | Mitigated by independence, not eliminated. For critical output, add a third reviewer or human spot-check. |
| Cost explosion | Too many iterations on large outputs | Batch sampling pattern. Budget caps per verification cycle. |
