If you previously copied `observe.sh` into `~/.claude/settings.json`, remove that duplicate `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` block. Duplicating the plugin hook causes double execution and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolution errors because that variable is only available inside plugin-managed `hooks/hooks.json` entries.

**If installed manually** to `~/.claude/skills`, add this to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "~/.claude/skills/continuous-learning-v2/hooks/observe.sh"
      }]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "~/.claude/skills/continuous-learning-v2/hooks/observe.sh"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### 2. Initialize Directory Structure

The system creates directories automatically on first use, but you can also create them manually:

```bash
# Global directories
mkdir -p "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/ecc-homunculus"/{instincts/{personal,inherited},evolved/{agents,skills,commands},projects}

# Project directories are auto-created when the hook first runs in a git repo
```

### 3. Use the Instinct Commands

```bash
/instinct-status     # Show learned instincts (project + global)
/evolve              # Cluster related instincts into skills/commands
/instinct-export     # Export instincts to file
/instinct-import     # Import instincts from others
/promote             # Promote project instincts to global scope
/projects            # List all known projects and their instinct counts
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/instinct-status` | Show all instincts (project-scoped + global) with confidence |
| `/evolve` | Cluster related instincts into skills/commands, suggest promotions |
| `/instinct-export` | Export instincts (filterable by scope/domain) |
| `/instinct-import <file>` | Import instincts with scope control |
| `/promote [id]` | Promote project instincts to global scope |
| `/projects` | List all known projects and their instinct counts |

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` to control the background observer:

```json
{
  "version": "2.1",
  "observer": {
    "enabled": false,
    "run_interval_minutes": 5,
    "min_observations_to_analyze": 20
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `observer.enabled` | `false` | Enable the background observer agent |
| `observer.run_interval_minutes` | `5` | How often the observer analyzes observations |
| `observer.min_observations_to_analyze` | `20` | Minimum observations before analysis runs |

Other behavior (observation capture, instinct thresholds, project scoping, promotion criteria) is configured via code defaults in `instinct-cli.py` and `observe.sh`.
