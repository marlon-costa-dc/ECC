## Where to Look
<!-- Example for a Next.js project — replace with detected paths -->
| I want to... | Look at... |
|--------------|-----------|
| Add an API endpoint | `src/app/api/` |
| Add a UI page | `src/app/(dashboard)/` |
| Add a database table | `prisma/schema.prisma` |
| Add a test | `tests/` matching the source path |
| Change build config | `next.config.ts` |
```

#### Output 2: Starter CLAUDE.md

Generate or update a project-specific CLAUDE.md based on detected conventions. If `CLAUDE.md` already exists, read it first and enhance it — preserve existing project-specific instructions and clearly call out what was added or changed.

```markdown
# Project Instructions

## Tech Stack
[Detected stack summary]

## Code Style
- [Detected naming conventions]
- [Detected patterns to follow]

## Testing
- Run tests: `[detected test command]`
- Test pattern: [detected test file convention]
- Coverage: [if configured, the coverage command]

## Build & Run
- Dev: `[detected dev command]`
- Build: `[detected build command]`
- Lint: `[detected lint command]`

## Project Structure
[Key directory → purpose map]

## Conventions
- [Commit style if detectable]
- [PR workflow if detectable]
- [Error handling patterns]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Don't read everything** — reconnaissance should use Glob and Grep, not Read on every file. Read selectively only for ambiguous signals.
2. **Verify, don't guess** — if a framework is detected from config but the actual code uses something different, trust the code.
3. **Respect existing CLAUDE.md** — if one already exists, enhance it rather than replacing it. Call out what's new vs existing.
4. **Stay concise** — the onboarding guide should be scannable in 2 minutes. Details belong in the code, not the guide.
5. **Flag unknowns** — if a convention can't be confidently detected, say so rather than guessing. "Could not determine test runner" is better than a wrong answer.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Generating a CLAUDE.md that's longer than 100 lines — keep it focused
- Listing every dependency — highlight only the ones that shape how you write code
- Describing obvious directory names — `src/` doesn't need an explanation
- Copying the README — the onboarding guide adds structural insight the README lacks

## Examples

### Example 1: First time in a new repo
**User**: "Onboard me to this codebase"
**Action**: Run full 4-phase workflow → produce Onboarding Guide + Starter CLAUDE.md
**Output**: Onboarding Guide printed directly to the conversation, plus a `CLAUDE.md` written to the project root

### Example 2: Generate CLAUDE.md for existing project
**User**: "Generate a CLAUDE.md for this project"
**Action**: Run Phases 1-3, skip Onboarding Guide, produce only CLAUDE.md
**Output**: Project-specific `CLAUDE.md` with detected conventions

### Example 3: Enhance existing CLAUDE.md
**User**: "Update the CLAUDE.md with current project conventions"
**Action**: Read existing CLAUDE.md, run Phases 1-3, merge new findings
**Output**: Updated `CLAUDE.md` with additions clearly marked
