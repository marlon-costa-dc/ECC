# SEO Reference

Detailed examples, formulas, and templates for the `seo` skill.

## Examples

### Title formula

```text
Primary Topic - Specific Modifier | Brand
```

### Meta description formula

```text
Action + topic + value proposition + one supporting detail
```

### JSON-LD example

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Page Title Here",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Author Name"
  },
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Brand Name"
  }
}
```

### Audit output shape

```text
[HIGH] Duplicate title tags on product pages
Location: src/routes/products/[slug].tsx
Issue: Dynamic titles collapse to the same default string, which weakens relevance and creates duplicate signals.
Fix: Generate a unique title per product using the product name and primary category.
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| keyword stuffing | write for users first |
| thin near-duplicate pages | consolidate or differentiate them |
| schema for content that is not actually present | match schema to reality |
| content advice without checking the actual page | read the real page first |
| generic "improve SEO" outputs | tie every recommendation to a page or asset |

## Structured Data Mapping

- homepage: `Organization` or local business schema where appropriate
- editorial pages: `Article` / `BlogPosting`
- product pages: `Product` and `Offer`
- interior pages: `BreadcrumbList`
- Q&A sections: `FAQPage` only when the content truly matches

## Performance Targets

- LCP < 2.5s
- INP < 200ms
- CLS < 0.1

Common fixes: preload hero assets, reduce render-blocking work, reserve layout space, trim heavy JS.
