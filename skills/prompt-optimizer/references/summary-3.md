Before executing, answer these questions in the blueprint:
1. Which domain boundaries exist in the current monolith?
2. Which service should be extracted first (lowest coupling)?
3. Communication pattern: REST APIs, gRPC, or event-driven (Kafka/RabbitMQ)?
4. Database strategy: shared DB initially or database-per-service from start?
5. Deployment target: Kubernetes, Docker Compose, or serverless?

The blueprint should produce phases like:
- Phase 1: Identify service boundaries and create domain map
- Phase 2: Set up infrastructure (API gateway, service mesh, CI/CD per service)
- Phase 3: Extract first service (strangler fig pattern)
- Phase 4: Verify with integration tests, then extract next service
- Phase N: Decommission monolith

Each phase = 1 PR, with /verify gates between phases.
Use /save-session between phases. Use /resume-session to continue.
Use git worktrees for parallel service extraction when dependencies allow.

Recommended: Opus 4.6 for blueprint planning, Sonnet 4.6 for phase execution.
