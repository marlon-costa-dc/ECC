# Healthcare Eval Harness — Patient Safety Verification

Automated verification system for healthcare application deployments. A single CRITICAL failure blocks deployment. Patient safety is non-negotiable.

> **Note:** Examples use Jest as the reference test runner. Adapt commands for your framework (Vitest, pytest, PHPUnit, etc.) — the test categories and pass thresholds are framework-agnostic.

## When to Use

- Before any deployment of EMR/EHR applications
- After modifying CDSS logic (drug interactions, dose validation, scoring)
- After changing database schemas that touch patient data
- After modifying authentication or access control
- During CI/CD pipeline configuration for healthcare apps
- After resolving merge conflicts in clinical modules

## How It Works

The eval harness runs five test categories in order. The first three (CDSS Accuracy, PHI Exposure, Data Integrity) are CRITICAL gates requiring 100% pass rate — a single failure blocks deployment. The remaining two (Clinical Workflow, Integration) are HIGH gates requiring 95%+ pass rate.

Each category maps to a Jest test path pattern. The CI pipeline runs CRITICAL gates with `--bail` (stop on first failure) and enforces coverage thresholds with `--coverage --coverageThreshold`.

### Eval Categories

**1. CDSS Accuracy (CRITICAL — 100% required)**

Tests all clinical decision support logic: drug interaction pairs (both directions), dose validation rules, clinical scoring vs published specs, no false negatives, no silent failures.

[See code example 1 in `code-examples.md`]

**2. PHI Exposure (CRITICAL — 100% required)**

Tests for protected health information leaks: API error responses, console output, URL parameters, browser storage, cross-facility isolation, unauthenticated access, service role key absence.

[See code example 2 in `code-examples.md`]

**3. Data Integrity (CRITICAL — 100% required)**

Tests clinical data safety: locked encounters, audit trail entries, cascade delete protection, concurrent edit handling, no orphaned records.

[See code example 3 in `code-examples.md`]

**4. Clinical Workflow (HIGH — 95%+ required)**

Tests end-to-end flows: encounter lifecycle, template rendering, medication sets, drug/diagnosis search, prescription PDF, red flag alerts.

[See code example 4 in `code-examples.md`]

**5. Integration Compliance (HIGH — 95%+ required)**

Tests external systems: HL7 message parsing (v2.x), FHIR validation, lab result mapping, malformed message handling.

[See code example 5 in `code-examples.md`]

### Pass/Fail Matrix

| Category | Threshold | On Failure |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| CDSS Accuracy | 100% | **BLOCK deployment** |
| PHI Exposure | 100% | **BLOCK deployment** |
| Data Integrity | 100% | **BLOCK deployment** |
| Clinical Workflow | 95%+ | WARN, allow with review |
| Integration | 95%+ | WARN, allow with review |
