# skill-stocktake

Slash command (`/skill-stocktake`) that audits all Claude skills and commands using a quality checklist + AI holistic judgment. Supports two modes: Quick Scan for recently changed skills, and Full Stocktake for a complete review.

## Scope

The command targets the following paths **relative to the directory where it is invoked**:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `~/.claude/skills/` | Global skills (all projects) |
| `{cwd}/.claude/skills/` | Project-level skills (if the directory exists) |

**At the start of Phase 1, the command explicitly lists which paths were found and scanned.**

### Targeting a specific project

To include project-level skills, run from that project's root directory:

[See code example 1 in `code-examples.md`]

If the project has no `.claude/skills/` directory, only global skills and commands are evaluated.

## Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Duration |
|------|---------|---------|
| Quick Scan | `results.json` exists (default) | 5–10 min |
| Full Stocktake | `results.json` absent, or `/skill-stocktake full` | 20–30 min |

**Results cache:** `~/.claude/skills/skill-stocktake/results.json`

## Quick Scan Flow

Re-evaluate only skills that have changed since the last run (5–10 min).

1. Read `~/.claude/skills/skill-stocktake/results.json`
2. Run: `bash ~/.claude/skills/skill-stocktake/scripts/quick-diff.sh \
         ~/.claude/skills/skill-stocktake/results.json`
   (Project dir is auto-detected from `$PWD/.claude/skills`; pass it explicitly only if needed)
3. If output is `[]`: report "No changes since last run." and stop
4. Re-evaluate only those changed files using the same Phase 2 criteria
5. Carry forward unchanged skills from previous results
6. Output only the diff
7. Run: `bash ~/.claude/skills/skill-stocktake/scripts/save-results.sh \
         ~/.claude/skills/skill-stocktake/results.json <<< "$EVAL_RESULTS"`

## Full Stocktake Flow

### Phase 1 — Inventory

Run: `bash ~/.claude/skills/skill-stocktake/scripts/scan.sh`

The script enumerates skill files, extracts frontmatter, and collects UTC mtimes.
Project dir is auto-detected from `$PWD/.claude/skills`; pass it explicitly only if needed.
Present the scan summary and inventory table from the script output:

[See code example 2 in `code-examples.md`]

| Skill | 7d use | 30d use | Description |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|

### Phase 2 — Quality Evaluation

Launch an Agent tool subagent (**general-purpose agent**) with the full inventory and checklist:

[See code example 3 in `code-examples.md`]

The subagent reads each skill, applies the checklist, and returns per-skill JSON:

`{ "verdict": "Keep"|"Improve"|"Update"|"Retire"|"Merge into [X]", "reason": "..." }`

**Chunk guidance:** Process ~20 skills per subagent invocation to keep context manageable. Save intermediate results to `results.json` (`status: "in_progress"`) after each chunk.

After all skills are evaluated: set `status: "completed"`, proceed to Phase 3.

**Resume detection:** If `status: "in_progress"` is found on startup, resume from the first unevaluated skill.

Each skill is evaluated against this checklist:

[See code example 4 in `code-examples.md`]

Verdict criteria:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Keep | Useful and current |
| Improve | Worth keeping, but specific improvements needed |
| Update | Referenced technology is outdated (verify with WebSearch) |
| Retire | Low quality, stale, or cost-asymmetric |
| Merge into [X] | Substantial overlap with another skill; name the merge target |

Evaluation is **holistic AI judgment** — not a numeric rubric. Guiding dimensions:
- **Actionability**: code examples, commands, or steps that let you act immediately
- **Scope fit**: name, trigger, and content are aligned; not too broad or narrow
- **Uniqueness**: value not replaceable by MEMORY.md / CLAUDE.md / another skill
- **Currency**: technical references work in the current environment
