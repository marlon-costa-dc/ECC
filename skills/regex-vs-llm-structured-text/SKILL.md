# Regex vs LLM for Structured Text Parsing

A practical decision framework for parsing structured text (quizzes, forms, invoices, documents). The key insight: regex handles 95-98% of cases cheaply and deterministically. Reserve expensive LLM calls for the remaining edge cases.

## When to Use

- Parsing structured text with repeating patterns (questions, forms, tables)
- Deciding between regex and LLM for text extraction
- Building hybrid pipelines that combine both approaches
- Optimizing cost/accuracy tradeoffs in text processing

## Workflow

1. Understand the request and confirm scope
2. Execute the canonical workflow for this skill
3. Report results and next steps
