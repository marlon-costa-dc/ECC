# Orchestrator Pipeline (shared engine)

The `orch-*` skills are thin wrappers. They do not re-implement any work — they
classify the request, choose which phases of *this* pipeline run, and delegate
each phase to an existing ECC agent or command. This file is that pipeline.

> Invoke an operation skill (`orch-add-feature`, `orch-fix-defect`, …) rather
> than this engine directly. This file is the reference they point at.

## When to Use

- Loaded indirectly whenever an `orch-*` operation skill runs.
- Read directly only when adding a new operation to the family or tuning the
  shared phases, gates, or agent map.

## The operation family

| Skill | Operation | Trigger | First move |
|-------|-----------|---------|------------|
| `orch-add-feature` | feature | capability does not exist yet | research + plan a new slice |
| `orch-change-feature` | tweak | works, but desired behavior differs | amend existing behavior *and its tests* |
| `orch-fix-defect` | fix | broken; behavior is wrong | reproduce as a failing test, then fix |
| `orch-refine-code` | refactor | behavior stays, structure improves | restructure while keeping tests green |
| `orch-build-mvp` | mvp | bootstrap from a design/spec doc | ingest doc → vertical slices |

> These wrappers **compose** existing ECC commands rather than replace them:
> `/feature-dev`, `/plan`, `/code-review`, `/build-fix`, `/refactor-clean`, and
> `/gan-build`, plus the `tdd-workflow` skill. The orch-* family adds the shared
> size classifier and the two gates
> on top of them, so one umbrella covers all five operations consistently.

## Step 0 — Classify size (right-sizing)

Ceremony scales to blast radius. Score the request on three signals, take the
**highest** tier any signal reaches, and state the result in one line so the user
can override:

| Tier | Files touched | New dependency / contract | Design ambiguity | Phases that run |
|------|---------------|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| trivial | 1, a few lines | none | none — the change is obvious | 4 → 5 → 6 |
| small | 1 file / 1 function | none | clear once you read the code | (1 light) → 4 → 5 → 6 |
| standard | 2–5 files | maybe a new internal module | one real choice to make | 1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 6 |
| large | many / cross-cutting | new external dep, public API, or a spec doc | multiple open questions | 1 → 2 → (3) → 4 → 5 → 6 |

Phase 0 (Intake) always runs and is omitted from the mask column above. The
tie-breaker: anything touching a security trigger (below) or a public API /
contract is **at least** standard, regardless of file count.

## The phases

Each phase delegates — it does not do the work inline.

- **0. Intake** — restate the request. For `orch-build-mvp`, read the spec/design
  doc and extract scope, locked decisions, and a feature list.
- **1. Research & Reuse** — per `rules/common/development-workflow.md`: `gh search repos` /
  `gh search code`, then Context7 / vendor docs, then package registries, then
  Exa. Prefer adopting a proven implementation over net-new code.
- **2. Plan** — delegate to the `planner` agent (or `architect` /
  `code-architect` for structural decisions). Output a `task_list` ordered as
  thin vertical slices. → **GATE 1.**
- **3. Scaffold** — `orch-build-mvp` only: stand up the first end-to-end slice.
- **4. Implement (TDD)** — drive each task through the `tdd-guide` agent (or the `tdd-workflow` skill):
  red → green → refactor. Honor the operation's first-move rule.
