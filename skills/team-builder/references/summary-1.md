1. Read each selected agent's markdown file
2. Prompt for the task description if not already provided
3. Spawn all agents in parallel using the Agent tool:
   - `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
   - `prompt: "{agent file content}\n\nTask: {task description}"`
   - Each agent runs independently — no inter-agent communication needed
4. If an agent fails (error, timeout, or empty output), note the failure inline (e.g., "Security Engineer: failed — [reason]") and continue with results from agents that succeeded

### Step 5: Synthesize Results

Collect all outputs and present a unified report:
- Results grouped by agent
- Synthesis section highlighting:
  - Agreements across agents
  - Conflicts or tensions between recommendations
  - Recommended next steps

If only 1 agent was selected, skip synthesis and present the output directly.

## Rules

- **Dynamic discovery only.** Never hardcode agent lists. New files in the directory auto-appear in the menu.
- **Max 5 agents per team.** More than 5 produces diminishing returns and excessive token usage. Enforce at selection time.
- **Parallel dispatch.** All agents run simultaneously — use the Agent tool's parallel invocation pattern.
- **Parallel Agent calls, not TeamCreate.** This skill uses parallel Agent tool calls for independent work. TeamCreate (a Claude Code tool for multi-agent dialogue) is only needed when agents must debate or respond to each other.

## Examples

```
User: team builder

Claude:
Available agent domains:
1. Engineering (2) — Software Architect, Security Engineer
2. Marketing (1) — SEO Specialist
3. Sales (4) — Discovery Coach, Outbound Strategist, Proposal Strategist, Sales Engineer
4. Support (1) — Executive Summary

Pick domains or name specific agents:

User: security + seo

Claude:
Selected: Security Engineer + SEO Specialist
What should they work on?

User: Review my Next.js e-commerce site before launch

[Both agents spawn in parallel, each applying their specialty to the codebase]

Claude:
## Security Engineer Findings
- [findings...]

## SEO Specialist Findings
- [findings...]

## Synthesis
Both agents agree on: [...]
Tension: Security recommends CSP that blocks inline styles, SEO needs inline schema markup. Resolution: [...]
Next steps: [...]
```
