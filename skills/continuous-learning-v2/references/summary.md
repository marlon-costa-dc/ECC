# Continuous Learning v2.1 - Instinct
-Based Architecture

An advanced learning system that turns your Claude Code sessions into reusable knowledge through atomic "instincts" - small learned behaviors with confidence scoring.

**v2.1** adds **project-scoped instincts** — React patterns stay in your React project, Python conventions stay in your Python project, and universal patterns (like "always validate input") are shared globally.

## When to Activate

- Setting up automatic learning from Claude Code sessions
- Configuring instinct-based behavior extraction via hooks
- Tuning confidence thresholds for learned behaviors
- Reviewing, exporting, or importing instinct libraries
- Evolving instincts into full skills, commands, or agents
- Managing project-scoped vs global instincts
- Promoting instincts from project to global scope

## What's New in v2.1

| Feature | v2.0 | v2.1 |
|---------|------|------|
| Storage | Global (`~/.claude/homunculus/`) | Project-scoped (`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/ecc-homunculus/projects/<hash>/`) |
| Scope | All instincts apply everywhere | Project-scoped + global |
| Detection | None | git remote URL / repo path |
| Promotion | N/A | Project → global when seen in 2+ projects |
| Commands | 4 (status/evolve/export/import) | 6 (+promote/projects) |
| Cross-project | Contamination risk | Isolated by default |

## What's New in v2 (vs v1)

| Feature | v1 | v2 |
|---------|----|----|
| Observation | Stop hook (session end) | PreToolUse/PostToolUse (100% reliable) |
| Analysis | Main context | Background agent (Haiku) |
| Granularity | Full skills | Atomic "instincts" |
| Confidence | None | 0.3-0.9 weighted |
| Evolution | Direct to skill | Instincts -> cluster -> skill/command/agent |
| Sharing | None | Export/import instincts |

## The Instinct Model

An instinct is a small learned behavior:

[See code example 1 in `code-examples.md`]

**Properties:**
- **Atomic** -- one trigger, one action
- **Confidence-weighted** -- 0.3 = tentative, 0.9 = near certain
- **Domain-tagged** -- code-style, testing, git, debugging, workflow, etc.
- **Evidence-backed** -- tracks what observations created it
- **Scope-aware** -- `project` (default) or `global`

## How It Works

[See code example 2 in `code-examples.md`]

## Project Detection

The system automatically detects your current project:

1. **`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` env var** (highest priority)
2. **`git remote get-url origin`** -- hashed to create a portable project ID (same repo on different machines gets the same ID)
3. **`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`** -- fallback using repo path (machine-specific)
4. **Global fallback** -- if no project is detected, instincts go to global scope

Each project gets a 12-character hash ID (e.g., `a1b2c3d4e5f6`). A registry file at `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/ecc-homunculus/projects.json` maps IDs to human-readable names.

### Data Directory

Continuous-learning-v2 stores observer data outside `~/.claude` so Claude Code's sensitive-path guard does not block background instinct writes:

1. `CLV2_HOMUNCULUS_DIR` when set to an absolute path
2. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ecc-homunculus`
3. `$HOME/.local/share/ecc-homunculus`

Existing users with data at `~/.claude/homunculus` can migrate once:

[See code example 3 in `code-examples.md`]

## Quick Start

### 1. Enable Observation Hooks

**If installed as a plugin** (recommended):

No extra `settings.json` hook block is required. Claude Code v2.1+ auto-loads the plugin `hooks/hooks.json`, and `observe.sh` is already registered there.
