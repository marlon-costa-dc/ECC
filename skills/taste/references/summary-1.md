# Extended guidance


1. **Taste is the last layer, and it must be decided first.** `video-editing` correctly
   says taste is the final human pass. The trap: if you only decide taste at the end, every
   generation and cut upstream was a guess. Pick the direction *before* the first prompt,
   then let it constrain everything.
2. **Coherence beats novelty.** One look executed across 30 shots beats 30 looks. A named
   genre (below) is a constraint that buys coherence for free.
3. **Cut to the song, not to the footage.** In a music video the timeline is the waveform.
   Every hard cut lands on a beat or a transient. Frame math is in the pipeline section.
4. **Generate selectively, edit ruthlessly.** AI makes b-roll that does not exist; it does
   not make taste. You still throw away 80%.

## The Aesthetic Vocabulary (distilled)

The reference corpus tours a large library of *named* visual genres. The full list lives in
`references/genre-taxonomy.md`. The useful move is not memorizing 70 names — it is seeing
that **a genre name is a complete prompt-and-grade preset.** When you pick one, you inherit
its palette, texture, lighting, and subject matter as a unit.

The genres cluster into families. Pick a **primary** family and at most **one accent**:

| Family | Genres in it | Reads as |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Ethereal / divine** | spiritualism, glacial folk, beacons, zen core, fairy tale | weightless, holy, glowing, soft |
| **Hyperpop / Y2K-cyber** | cyberdelia, acid house, acid nora, neo aggressano, new liquid | glossy, chrome, neon, kawaii-cyber |
| **Dark / occult** | dark academia, smoke nostalgia, communist core, abstract tech | high-contrast, ominous, grain |
| **Retro / print** | retro surfers, art deco, adventure pulp, classic advertising, magazine collage, bumper stickers | flat, graphic, halftone, nostalgic |
| **Organic / textural** | microbiology core, weaving patterns, fruitage retro, cozy blanket, pacific punk wave | tactile, macro, woven, wet |
| **Systemic / data** | numbers, mazes, code web, heatmap, pixel, 8-bit | gridded, generative, schematic |

**For the current project**, the primary is **Ethereal / divine** with a **Hyperpop / Y2K-cyber**
accent — i.e. holy light and crystalline bloom, punctuated by chrome and neon. That pairing
*is* the angelcore × cloud-trance brief.

## The Mood System — angelcore × cloud-trance

Distilled directly from the strongest reference reels. This is the concrete grade.

### Palette
- **Base:** near-black void (#05060a) and bone white (#f4f1ea). Most frames are one or the other.
- **Divine accent:** molten gold / ember orange (#ffb24d → #ff7a18) — the *one warm light* in the dark.
- **Crystalline accent:** iridescent violet→cyan→magenta bokeh (#8a6bff, #4fc3ff, #ff6ad5) — the
  hyperpop bloom, used in bright frames.
- **Danger accent (sparingly):** a single glowing red (#ff2a2a) on monochrome — for one or two
  shock cuts only.
- **Hyperpop subject:** candy pink hair / chrome / glossy white against blue sky.

Rule: **one accent per shot.** Gold lives in dark frames; iridescence lives in light frames;
never both in one shot.

### Light & texture
- Darkness pierced by a single warm source (ember bloom, divine shaft). High contrast, deep blacks.
- Crystalline / glitter bokeh, lens flares, bloom, light leaks — *heavenly*, not dirty.
