# ClickHouse Analytics Queries — Extended Reference

Extended examples for ClickHouse analytics workloads. The SKILL.md file contains the essential table-design and query-optimization patterns; this file preserves detailed analytics query patterns, data pipeline examples, and monitoring queries.

## Window Functions

```sql
-- Calculate running totals
SELECT
    date,
    market_id,
    volume,
    sum(volume) OVER (
        PARTITION BY market_id
        ORDER BY date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS cumulative_volume
FROM markets_analytics
WHERE date >= today() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
ORDER BY market_id, date;
```

## Data Insertion Patterns

### Bulk Insert (Recommended)

```typescript
import { ClickHouse } from 'clickhouse'

const clickhouse = new ClickHouse({
  url: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_URL,
  port: 8123,
  basicAuth: {
    username: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_USER,
    password: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD
  }
})

async function bulkInsertTrades(trades: Trade[]) {
  const values = trades.map(trade => `(
    '${trade.id}',
    '${trade.market_id}',
    '${trade.user_id}',
    ${trade.amount},
    '${trade.timestamp.toISOString()}'
  )`).join(',')

  await clickhouse.query(`
    INSERT INTO trades (id, market_id, user_id, amount, timestamp)
    VALUES ${values}
  `).toPromise()
}
```

### Streaming Insert

```typescript
import { createWriteStream } from 'fs'
import { pipeline } from 'stream/promises'

async function streamInserts() {
  const stream = clickhouse.insert('trades').stream()
  for await (const batch of dataSource) {
    stream.write(batch)
  }
  await stream.end()
}
```

## Materialized Views

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW market_stats_hourly_mv
TO market_stats_hourly
AS SELECT
    toStartOfHour(timestamp) AS hour,
    market_id,
    sumState(amount) AS total_volume,
    countState() AS total_trades,
    uniqState(user_id) AS unique_users
FROM trades
GROUP BY hour, market_id;
```

## Performance Monitoring

```sql
-- Check slow queries
SELECT
    query_id,
    user,
    query,
    query_duration_ms,
    read_rows,
    read_bytes,
    memory_usage
FROM system.query_log
WHERE type = 'QueryFinish'
  AND query_duration_ms > 1000
  AND event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
ORDER BY query_duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check table sizes
SELECT
    database,
    table,
    formatReadableSize(sum(bytes)) AS size,
    sum(rows) AS rows,
    max(modification_time) AS latest_modification
FROM system.parts
WHERE active
GROUP BY database, table
ORDER BY sum(bytes) DESC;
```

## Common Analytics Queries

### Time Series Analysis

```sql
-- Daily active users
SELECT
    toDate(timestamp) AS date,
    uniq(user_id) AS daily_active_users
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= today() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;

-- Retention analysis
SELECT
    signup_date,
    countIf(days_since_signup = 0) AS day_0,
    countIf(days_since_signup = 1) AS day_1,
    countIf(days_since_signup = 7) AS day_7,
    countIf(days_since_signup = 30) AS day_30
FROM (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        min(toDate(timestamp)) AS signup_date,
        toDate(timestamp) AS activity_date,
        dateDiff('day', signup_date, activity_date) AS days_since_signup
    FROM events
    GROUP BY user_id, activity_date
)
GROUP BY signup_date
ORDER BY signup_date DESC;
```

### Funnel Analysis

```sql
SELECT
    countIf(step = 'viewed_market') AS viewed,
    countIf(step = 'clicked_trade') AS clicked,
    countIf(step = 'completed_trade') AS completed,
