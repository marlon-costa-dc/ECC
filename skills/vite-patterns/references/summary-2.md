**Critical callout:** `vite build` transpiles but does NOT type-check. Type errors silently ship to production unless you add `vite-plugin-checker` or run `tsc --noEmit` in CI.

#### Authoring Custom Plugins

Authoring is rare — most needs are covered by existing plugins. When you do need one, start inline in `vite.config.ts` and only extract if reused.

[See code example 3 in `code-examples.md`]

**Key hooks:** `transform` (modify source), `resolveId` + `load` (virtual modules), `transformIndexHtml` (inject into HTML), `configureServer` (add dev middleware), `hotUpdate` (custom HMR — replaces deprecated `handleHotUpdate` in v7+).
