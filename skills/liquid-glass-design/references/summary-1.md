| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| GlassEffectContainer wrapping | Performance optimization, enables morphing between glass elements |
| `spacing` parameter | Controls merge distance — fine-tune how close elements must be to blend |
| `@Namespace` + `glassEffectID` | Enables smooth morphing transitions on view hierarchy changes |
| `interactive()` modifier | Explicit opt-in for touch/pointer reactions — not all glass should respond |
| UIGlassContainerEffect in UIKit | Same container pattern as SwiftUI for consistency |
| Accented rendering mode in widgets | System applies tinted glass when user selects tinted Home Screen |

## Best Practices

- **Always use GlassEffectContainer** when applying glass to multiple sibling views — it enables morphing and improves rendering performance
- **Apply `.glassEffect()` after** other appearance modifiers (frame, font, padding)
- **Use `.interactive()`** only on elements that respond to user interaction (buttons, toggleable items)
- **Choose spacing carefully** in containers to control when glass effects merge
- **Use `withAnimation`** when changing view hierarchies to enable smooth morphing transitions
- **Test across appearances** — light mode, dark mode, and accented/tinted modes
- **Ensure accessibility contrast** — text on glass must remain readable

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Using multiple standalone `.glassEffect()` views without a GlassEffectContainer
- Nesting too many glass effects — degrades performance and visual clarity
- Applying glass to every view — reserve for interactive elements, toolbars, and cards
- Forgetting `clipsToBounds = true` in UIKit when using corner radii
- Ignoring accented rendering mode in widgets — breaks tinted Home Screen appearance
- Using opaque backgrounds behind glass — defeats the translucency effect

## When to Use

- Navigation bars, toolbars, and tab bars with the new iOS 26 design
- Floating action buttons and card-style containers
- Interactive controls that need visual depth and touch feedback
- Widgets that should integrate with the system's Liquid Glass appearance
- Morphing transitions between related UI states
