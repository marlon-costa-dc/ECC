Map intent + scope + tech stack (from Phase 0) to specific ECC components.

| Other / Unlisted | coding-standards (universal) | code-reviewer |

### Phase 4: Missing Context Detection

Scan the prompt for missing critical information. Check each item and mark
whether Phase 0 auto-detected it or the user must supply it:

- [ ] **Tech stack** — Detected in Phase 0, or must user specify?
- [ ] **Target scope** — Files, directories, or modules mentioned?
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria** — How to know the task is done?
- [ ] **Error handling** — Edge cases and failure modes addressed?
- [ ] **Security requirements** — Auth, input validation, secrets?
- [ ] **Testing expectations** — Unit, integration, E2E?
- [ ] **Performance constraints** — Load, latency, resource limits?
- [ ] **UI/UX requirements** — Design specs, responsive, a11y? (if frontend)
- [ ] **Database changes** — Schema, migrations, indexes? (if data layer)
- [ ] **Existing patterns** — Reference files or conventions to follow?
- [ ] **Scope boundaries** — What NOT to do?

**If 3+ critical items are missing**, ask the user up to 3 clarification
questions before generating the optimized prompt. Then incorporate the
answers into the optimized prompt.

### Phase 5: Workflow & Model Recommendation

Determine where this prompt sits in the development lifecycle:

```
Research → Plan → Implement (TDD) → Review → Verify → Commit
```

For MEDIUM+ tasks, always start with /plan. For EPIC tasks, use blueprint skill.

**Model recommendation** (include in output):

| Scope | Recommended Model | Rationale |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| TRIVIAL-LOW | Sonnet 4.6 | Fast, cost-efficient for simple tasks |
| MEDIUM | Sonnet 4.6 | Best coding model for standard work |
| HIGH | Sonnet 4.6 (main) + Opus 4.6 (planning) | Opus for architecture, Sonnet for implementation |
| EPIC | Opus 4.6 (blueprint) + Sonnet 4.6 (execution) | Deep reasoning for multi-session planning |

**Multi-prompt splitting** (for HIGH/EPIC scope):

For tasks that exceed a single session, split into sequential prompts:
- Prompt 1: Research + Plan (use search-first skill, then /plan)
- Prompt 2-N: Implement one phase per prompt (each ends with /verify)
- Final Prompt: Integration test + /code-review across all phases
- Use /save-session and /resume-session to preserve context between sessions

## Output Format

Present your analysis in this exact structure. Respond in the same language
as the user's input.

### Section 1: Prompt Diagnosis

**Strengths:** List what the original prompt does well.

**Issues:**

| Issue | Impact | Suggested Fix |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| (problem) | (consequence) | (how to fix) |
