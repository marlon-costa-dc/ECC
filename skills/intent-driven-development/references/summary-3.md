| Risk area | Applies? | Required handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security/privacy | Yes/No | <redaction, authorization, review, etc.> |
| Persistent data/migration | Yes/No | <compatibility, backup, rollback, etc.> |

| UX/accessibility | Yes/No | <manual or automated evidence> |

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: <observable behavior>
- **Scenario:** <starting condition>
- **Action:** <single trigger>
- **Expected:** <observable result>
- **Must not:** <prohibited side effect, if applicable>
- **Verification:** <method and intended evidence>
- **Environment/safety:** <constraints, if applicable>
- **Priority:** Required | Important | Optional

## Blocking Decisions

- [ ] <only decisions that prevent safe or correct progress>

## Verification Plan

| Criterion | Verification evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AC-001 | <test/check/review command or evidence type> | Pending |
```

## Pass/Fail Examples

Use these to judge whether the skill actually produced a verifiable brief, not planning prose.

**A failing acceptance criterion**

```
AC-001: The export works correctly and is secure.
```

Fails — "works correctly" and "secure" are not observable, there is no scenario, trigger,
expected result, or verification method, and nothing states what must not happen. A reader
cannot tell whether the implementation satisfied it.

**A passing acceptance criterion**

```
AC-001: Export generates file with correct headers
- Scenario: authenticated user, at least one data row visible
- Action: click "Export CSV"
- Expected: browser downloads file with columns [id, name, created_at]
- Must not: expose internal fields or rows belonging to other users
- Verification: automated integration test + manual schema spot-check
- Priority: Required
```

Passes — a concrete observable outcome, a prohibited side effect, and a named verification
method. Two people would agree on whether it was met.

**A failing context entry**

```
Discovered facts: Users on the free tier are limited to 100 exports per month.
```

Fails — a per-tier limit is a business rule. It must not appear under discovered facts inferred
from code; it belongs under Product/business constraints, supplied by the user, or be listed as
an assumption to confirm.

### Pass/Fail Rubric

A brief passes only if every answer is "yes". Any "no" means revise before returning it.

- [ ] Does every required criterion have a scenario, an observable expected result, and a named verification method?
- [ ] Are all vague terms ("correctly", "secure", "fast", "robust") either replaced with observable evidence or marked as human judgment?
- [ ] Are product/business constraints listed as supplied/assumed, with none silently inferred from code?
- [ ] Is scope explicit, with out-of-scope items named?
- [ ] Are blocking decisions limited to choices that actually affect safety or correctness, not preferences?

## Quality Check

Before returning the brief, check:

- The goal describes an outcome rather than an implementation choice.
- Scope boundaries and assumptions are explicit.
- Every required criterion is observable or clearly marked for human judgment.
- Security, privacy, data, compatibility, external-effect, and UX risks were considered only
  where relevant and not silently ignored.
- Verification methods identify safe environments for risky operations.
- No secret or production-sensitive information was copied into the output.
- No repository mutation or implementation block is imposed without justification or request.

## Handoff

When another planning or implementation workflow is available, pass the acceptance brief or
criterion IDs to it. When no dedicated workflow exists, provide the brief directly as the
implementation reference. Do not assume any named skill or tool is installed.
