# Code Examples

## Example 1

```
Goal: Authenticated users can download dashboard data as a CSV file.
In scope: Export of currently filtered rows; filename includes date.
Out of scope: Scheduled exports, email delivery, Excel format.
Assumptions: Max row count is under 10k; no PII in exported fields.

AC-001: Export generates file with correct headers
- Scenario: authenticated user, at least one data row visible
- Action: click "Export CSV"
- Expected: browser downloads file with columns [id, name, created_at]
- Must not: expose internal fields or rows belonging to other users
- Verification: automated integration test + manual schema spot-check
- Priority: Required
```
