### Phase 2: Scope Assessment

If Phase 0 detected a project, use codebase size as a signal. Otherwise, estimate
from the prompt description alone and mark the estimate as uncertain.

| Scope | Heuristic | Orchestration |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| TRIVIAL | Single file, < 50 lines | Direct execution |
| LOW | Single component or module | Single command or skill |
| MEDIUM | Multiple components, same domain | Command chain + /verify |
| HIGH | Cross-domain, 5+ files | /plan first, then phased execution |
| EPIC | Multi-session, multi-PR, architectural shift | Use blueprint skill for multi-session plan |
